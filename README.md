# Matrix_Multiplication_SSE-SSE2-
This is a C++ source code that I developed for my advanced architecture homework. 
In this program, I compared the total execution time of MM benchmark for 4 input data sizes and 3 different compiler optimization options (-O, -O2, -O3). 
I implemented my code with SSE and SSE2 instruction sets, for different programming variables including integer, float and double.
For more information, please read report file.
