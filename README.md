# Matrix Multiplication Using SSE/SSE2
The C++ source code for implementing the Matrix Multiplication (MM) function using SSE and SSE2 instructions. 
I compared the total execution time of the MM for different input data sizes and three different compiler optimization options (-O, -O2, -O3). 
This code also supports different variables including integer, float, and double.
